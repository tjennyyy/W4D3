        A6: You are hired by the Austrian government to help reduce tensions and smooth the operation of government.
        You will be paid 1 million € in taxpayer money to do the following:
        1. Make a static method “calmString” that will take a String representing a speech, and remove all the exclamation marks and all mention of
        the word “Ibiza” (IBIZA, ibiza, and Ibiza should disappear). If you pass in null, the method should return null.
        2. Use JUnit to test it.
        3. Make a static method “calmAttendees” that will take a List of political parties members invited to social events.
        It can contain “SPÖ”, “ÖVP”, “Grüne”, “FPÖ”, “NEOS” and “PILZ” elements.
        If the list contains both "FPÖ" and "Grün", it should remove one of the two, but do so at random
        (i.e., half the time removing "FPÖ" and half the time removing "Grüne"). Otherwise it should leave the List unchanged. If you pass in null,
        the method should do nothing.
        4. Use JUnit to test it.
        Note: Use for instance this list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_European_Parliament_for_Austria,_2014%E2%80%9319
